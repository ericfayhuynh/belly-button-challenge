# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

Hello! I'm Eric, and I've created this interactive dashboard to explore and visualize the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the various microbes, also known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), that colonize human navels. Through this dashboard, users can delve into the microbial diversity of human belly buttons and discover the most prevalent microbes across different individuals.

## Features

This dashboard offers several interactive features, including:

- **A Dropdown Menu**: Users can select different test subject ID numbers to display the microbial data specific to each individual.
- **Bar Chart**: Visualizes the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: Each sample's microbial data is displayed, showing the relative frequency of microbes by size and the OTU ID by colors.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for the structure and styling of the webpage.
- Bootstrap for responsive design.
- D3.js for reading in the `samples.json` file and handling dynamic changes.
- Plotly.js for creating interactive visualizations.

## How to Use

To use the dashboard, simply select a test subject ID number from the dropdown menu. The charts will automatically update to reflect the data for the selected individual. Hover over the charts to see additional information about the microbes present in each sample.

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the project is located.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the dashboard.

## Deployment

The dashboard has been deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access. You can view the deployed dashboard [here](<link-to-your-deployed-dashboard>).

## Repository

The GitHub repository for this project can be found [here](<link-to-your-github-repo>).

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank the instructors and TAs of the UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp for their guidance throughout this project. Additionally, the dataset used for this project was provided by [The Public Science Lab](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/).
